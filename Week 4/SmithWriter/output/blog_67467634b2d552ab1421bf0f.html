        <h2>Introduction to the Internet</h2>
        <p>The Internet has fundamentally transformed human communication and interaction, evolving from a military project into a global network that connects billions of users. This blog explores the intricate history of the Internet, from its inception with ARPANET to its current capabilities and future potential. Understanding its past is crucial in navigating an increasingly digital future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Birth of the Internet: ARPANET</h2>
        <p>The journey of the Internet begins with ARPANET, a project funded by the U.S. Department of Defense that sought to enable communication between various research institutions during a time of intense political and military tension.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>The Cold War and the Need for Networking</h3>
            <p>The backdrop to ARPANET's development was the Cold War, where technological superiority was paramount. The U.S. military recognized the vulnerabilities in centralized communication systems, fearing they could be easily disrupted. As a solution, a decentralized network was conceived to maintain communication even in the event of nuclear strikes, allowing for critical data transfer and collaboration among researchers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Development of ARPANET</h3>
            <p>Initiated in the late 1960s, ARPANET utilized packet-switching techniques to transfer data. Researchers at UCLA and Stanford were among the first connected nodes, allowing for the first email transmissions and file sharing. This innovative approach set the groundwork for future network architectures and established key protocols for data transmission. By 1971, ARPANET had grown to include 15 connected nodes, paving the way for broader connectivity.</p>
