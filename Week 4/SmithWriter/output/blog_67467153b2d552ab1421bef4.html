        <h2>Understanding Mental Health in the Workplace</h2>
        <p>Mental health in the workplace refers to the emotional and psychological well-being of employees. It encompasses how individuals manage stress, relate to others, and make choices. Recognizing and addressing mental health is crucial because a supportive environment promotes better performance, enhances job satisfaction, and reduces absenteeism. Organizations that prioritize mental wellness not only support their employees but also foster a culture of respect and understanding.

Mental health is relevant to workplace dynamics as it influences productivity, communication, and overall workplace atmosphere. Employers should strive to create strategies that support mental well-being as a core aspect of their business model.</p>

            <h3>Defining Mental Health and Its Relevance</h3>
            <p>Defining mental health in the workplace involves understanding emotional balance, stress management, and the ability to cope with daily challenges. It is relevant because mental well-being directly affects both individual performance and the collective output of teams. A mentally healthy workforce is more resilient, innovative, and engaged, contributing positively to the organization’s goals.</p>
