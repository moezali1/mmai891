        <h2>Understanding Cryptocurrency</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrency has emerged as a revolutionary form of digital currency, leveraged by the power of blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralized manner, offering various benefits and risks.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that utilizes cryptography for security. Unlike physical currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies operate on technology called blockchain, ensuring transactions are secure and anonymous. Bitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most well-known examples.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrency works through a technology called blockchain, which acts as a public ledger for all transactions. When a transaction occurs, it is verified by a network of computers (nodes) and recorded on the blockchain. This decentralized confirmation process prevents fraud and unauthorized manipulation. Moreover, cryptocurrencies can be obtained through mining, trading, or as a form of payment for goods and services.</p>
