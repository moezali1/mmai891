        <p>The concept of a side hustle has gained significant traction in recent years, as more individuals seek ways to supplement their income, explore their passions, or achieve financial independence.

        <h2>2. Why Start a Side Hustle?</h2>
        <p>Starting a side hustle can serve various purposes - from earning extra money to personal growth. But what drives people to find that balance despite their full-time commitments? Let’s explore the key motivations behind kicking off a side hustle.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2.1. Financial Benefits</h3>
            <p>One of the primary reasons to start a side hustle is the potential for financial gain. In an uncertain economy, having an additional source of income can provide much-needed security.

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4.3. Setting Boundaries</h3>
            <p>Establish boundaries to protect your full-time job and personal life. Communicate with family and friends about your side hustle commitments so they can support you, and don’t neglect self-care—remain mindful of your mental and emotional health.</p>
