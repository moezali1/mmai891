    "Course Syllabus\n",
    "Updated August 7, 2024\n",
    "COURSE DESCRIPTION\n",
    "This course has two core components:\n",
    "1.\tNatural Language Processing\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the six AI disciplines. We will discuss the major practice areas of NLP and several of its use-cases across many different industries. These key areas include Information Extraction, Document Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Language Generation, Chatbots, and Machine Translation. \n",
    "We will thoroughly cover text preprocessing and vectorization, as they are foundations for training NLP models. You will gain comprehensive knowledge of the tools and techniques necessary for effectively managing text data. This includes text preprocessing, text data visualization, and text vectorization / embeddings.\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT have ushered in a paradigm shift in NLP, making them an indispensable asset for solving a wide range of language-related tasks. We will also briefly cover Transfer Learning and Transformer architecture in NLP, highlighting their significant impact on language models like GPT, Claude, LLaMa, Mistral, BARD, etc. Finally, we will explore how OpenAI's ChatGPT (and other LLM’s) are revolutionizing the operational landscape by studying practical use-cases of LLM’s.\n",
    "2.\tBig Data Engineering\n",
    "We will explore big data engineering, covering key technologies such as Apache Hadoop, Spark, Relational and Non-Relational Database, and Cloud platforms. You will learn the history of big data, fundamentals, and the current trends.\n",
    "We will also delve into advanced topics for machine learning system design. This includes an overview of several key technologies used in Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) such as Docker, Kubernetes, Microservices architecture, Experiment Logging, etc. Through a combination of theory and demos, you will gain practical insights into the foundations of big data engineering.\n",

    "1. Class Participation\n",
    "Class participation is integral to the learning process and constitutes 20% of the course grade. Effective participation goes beyond mere attendance; it requires active engagement in classroom discussions, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the course materials. Students are encouraged to actively listen, thoughtfully contribute to discussions, and engage with different viewpoints.\n",
    "A key aspect of class participation is the ability to ask meaningful questions that reflect deep engagement with the course content. Good questions are clear, concise, and stimulate further discussion. They should showcase critical thinking and a genuine curiosity about the subject matter.\n",
    "Sharing use-cases, real-life experience, a new information on the subject based on your expertise and as it relates to the content is another way to demonstrate strong class participation.\n",
    "2. Individual Assignment\n",
